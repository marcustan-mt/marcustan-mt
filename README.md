👋 Hi, I'm Marcus Tan! I enjoy orchestrating the entire data journey, from crafting and implementing robust pipelines to dissecting data insights and weaving compelling narratives. As a BI Engineer at Amazon, my role encapsulates crafting vivid visualizations, constructing predictive models, and deploying them to drive informed decision-making.


Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌱

Outside of work, I also:
- 🌱 In 2024, I'm learning: machine learning and ML deployments.
- 📝 Document my learnings so that people can join me on this learning journey; marcustan.super.site.
- 📌 Curate papers, videos, and learnings that I have read for people who are new to machine learning.
