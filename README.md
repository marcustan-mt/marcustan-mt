ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcustan!
ðŸ‘€ I enjoy orchestrating the entire data journey, from crafting and implementing robust pipelines to dissecting data insights and weaving compelling narratives. As a BI Engineer at Amazon, my role encapsulates crafting vivid visualizations, constructing predictive models, and deploying them to drive informed decision-making.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning deployments and documenting my learning journey on marcustan.super.site! Feel free to reach out if you would like to share any content that you are learning recently!
