👋 Hi, I'm Marcus Tan!

I enjoy orchestrating the entire data journey, from crafting and implementing robust pipelines to dissecting data insights and weaving compelling narratives. As a BI Engineer at Amazon, my role encapsulates crafting vivid visualizations, constructing predictive models, and deploying them to drive informed decision-making. 

🌱 In 2024, I'm learning: machine learning and ML deployments.
